# Mux Android Distribution Plugin

This is Mux's Gradle plugin for distributing our multi-variant Android Libraries. It automatically creates publications
for each build
variant that should be published, allowing them to be published to a remote repository. This plugin offers some
improvements over Google's library publishing API, such as the ability to programmatically customize the coordinates on
a per-variant basis, the generation of version strings, and a predicate-based interface for selecting which variants to
publish. It also attaches javadoc and sources by default!

This plugin works alongside/on top of Google's new library publishing APIs and does not replace it. This plugin
optionally supports Artifactory, though customizing the artifactory integration is still TODO

## Basic Usage

### Configure `buildscript`

In your project's top-level `build.gradle` file, add our repo and add the dependency

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://muxinc.jfrog.io/artifactory/default-maven-local' }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.mux.gradle.android:mux-android-distribution:1.1.0'
  }
}
```

### Apply, Configure & Go

In your Library Module's `build.gradle`, apply this plugin:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.android.library'
  id 'com.mux.gradle.android.mux-android-distribution'
}
```

This is a very basic config that will release all (non-debug) variants of your library, with the same group ID,
and `artifactId`s equal to the name and first product flavor.

```groovy
muxDistribution {
  groupIds just("com.your.organization.or.site")
  publishIf { true }
  publicReleaseIf { true }
  pom {
    developers {
      developer {
        name = "Your Name/Team"
        email = "email@company.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After that's done, you can publish using your normal publishing tasks, either `publishVariantNameToRepo`
or `artifactoryPublish` or whatever strategy you use

```shell
$ ./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToGitHubPackagesRepository
# Or possibly
$ ./gradlew artifactoryPublish
```

## Advanced Usage

The plugin is very configurable. Artifact IDs, Group IDs, and Versions can be generated on a per-variant basis. There
are a few built-in strategies for generating each, and you can also write your own.

For example, Here's the configuration we use for our Data SDK for ExoPlayer:

```groovy
muxDistribution {
  devVersion versionFromCommitHash('dev-')
  releaseVersion versionFromTag()
  artifactIds artifactFromFlavorValue('exoplayer')
  groupIds just("com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats")
  publicReleaseIf releaseOnTag()

  packageJavadocs = releaseOnTag().call()
  publishIf { it.containsIgnoreCase("release") }
  artifactoryConfig {
    contextUrl = "https://muxinc.jfrog.io/artifactory/"
    releaseRepoKey = 'default-maven-release-local'
    devRepoKey = 'default-maven-local'
  }
}
```

### Pick Which Variants are Distributed

By default, all non-debug variants are distributed by this plugin. If you want the plugin to skip certain variants, you
can do so according to your own logic. Some prebuilt functions are provided

```groovy
muxDistribution {
  // publish all variants whose build type is one of "release" or "release-fat"
  publishIf = publishAllOfBuildTypes("release", "release-fat")
  // publish all non-debuggable variants
  publishIf = publishIfReleaseBuild()
  // publish all variants that have the flavor "companyWhiteLabel"
  publishIf { it.name.contains('companyWhiteLabel') }
}
```

### Configure Coordinates

#### Using your own logic

You can also supply your own logic for generating coordinates. The object passed into these Closures is the full name of
the variant
For example,

```groovy
muxDistribution {
  // artifactId should be generated by prepending 'library_' to the name
  artifactIds { variant -> "library_${variant}" }
  // Release builds should all have the same version name: 1.0.1
  releaseVersion = just("1.0.1")
  // Dev builds should also include the CI build number if available
  devVersion { "1.0.1-dev-${System.getenv("BUILD_NUMBER")}" }
  // GroupId should be variant-sensitive
  groupIds { it.contains("whiteLabelA") ? "com.companyA.library.android" : "com.own.company.library.android" }
}
```

#### Prebuilt Functions

There are prebuilt strategies creating maven coordinates. They cover some common cases, and you might find them useful.

| Coordinate                           | Strategy                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| artifactId                           | `artifactFromProjectName`                        | generates an artifact ID from the name of the project/library module                                                                                                                            |
| artifactId                           | `artifactFromFirstFlavor`                        | generates an artifact ID from the name of the project/library module, then adding the value of the variant's first product flavor                                                               |
| artifactId                           | `artifactFromAllFlavors`                         | generates an artifact ID from the name of the project/library module, then concatenating the values of each flavor (in dimension order)                                                         |
| artifactId                           | `artifactFromFlavorValue`                        | generates an artifact ID from the name of the project/library module, then adding the value of the variant's product flavor with the given dimension name.                                      |
| version (devVersion, releaseVersion) | `versionFromHeadCommit`                          | generates a version name from the message of the HEAD commit of the current branch, looking for a token that looks like `v1.2.3` or something similarly-formatted                               |
| version (devVersion, releaseVersion) | `versionFromCommitHash(@Nullable String prefix)` | generates a version name from the hash of the current HEAD commit, and the name of the branch. You can supply a prefix, like `'dev-'` or `'beta-'` or whatever                                  |
| version (devVersion, releaseVersion) | `versionFromTag`                                 | generates a version name from name of currently checked-out tag, or the most recent tag on your branch. If the name starts with something like `v1.2.3` the `1.2.3` will be pulled out and used | 
| anything                             | `just(String)`                                   | Sets every variant's coordinate to the same supplied value. Can be used for any of: `groupIds`, `artifactIds`, `releaseVersion`, `devVersion`                                                   |

## Using Artifactory

This plugin supports artifactory distribution. You just need to supply your context URL, dev and release repo keys. This
plugin will look for Artifactory login credentials in the following places: `local.properties` in the
properties `artifactoryUser`/`artifactory_password`, and in the environment
variables `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_artifactory_user` and `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_artifactory_password`. You can also supply the
credentials in the plugin DSL, but this is not recommended except for debugging purposes

Artifactory provides only one task for publishing, so the destination repo depends on the `publicReleaseIf` function you
provide to the plugin.

```groovy
muxDistribution {
  artifactoryConfig {
    // For quick debugging, you can put credentials here. Otherwise prefer local.properties 
    username = "xxx@yyy.com"
    password = "hunter2"

    contextUrl = 'http://yourcompany.jfrog.io/artifactory'
    devRepoKey = 'dev-repo'
    releaseRepoKey = 'release-repo'
  }
}
```

## Distributing Updates of this Plugin

To distribute an update of this plugin, all you have to do is bump the plugin version in `build.gradle` then create a
new release. An Action will deploy to Artifactory/packages from there.
